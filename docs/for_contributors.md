# Attention

Everything must be properly documented!

Well, you might ask how a proper documentation must be done?

Actually, I don't know either yet.

Perhaps we can start by creating some general descriptions for each folder/package in this repository. We'll put each descriptions in this folder.

## Example

For example, we write a summary of what is `utils` for. We put it in a file named `utils_desc.md` and put in the folder `.\docs\utils\`.

From that we now also have our conventions. Each description doc is named in this way, `[folder_name]_desc.md`. For each subdirectory, we create a dedicated folder for them, `.\docs\[folder_name]\`.

## Other

For the documentation format, there's still no standard to follow. For now, just make sure it is easy to follow.
